# Computer-Graphics-Projects
4 Projects that dive into the basic concepts of Computer Graphics. <br>
* 2D/3D Transformations
* Lighting Theory
* Camera Theory
* Textures
* 3D Models
<br>
The 4th and final project is in a different project folder because the configuration properties<br>
are different. Visual Studio 2019 was used.<br>
Because the project folders are too big to upload follow the Google Drive Link to gain<br>
access to them -> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GNByWtGqAhhrigxtqv_bHUChwkI-xMnK?usp=drive_link
<br>
---All Project Results are shown in the SHOWCASE folder---
